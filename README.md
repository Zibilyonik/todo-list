# Todo List
A project based on JS that allows users to keep track of their tasks. The tasks can be edited and reordered to the user's desire.




## Project Description
This JS project allows users to keep their days organised by allowing them to add, mark, order and edit tasks as they wish.
Users can:
- Create tasks
- Change the display order of the tasks by dragging them from the list items(excluding text, button and checkbox)
- Mark their tasks as complete by using the checkboxes
- Edit the description of their tasks by clicking on the current description text. ***to accept the changes, simply click outside of the edit area***
- Delete the tasks by clicking the "Delete" button located on the list item
- Delete all tasks marked as complete by clicking on the "Clear All Completed Tasks" button

This way, users can keep their to-do list clean and organised for a productive day.
